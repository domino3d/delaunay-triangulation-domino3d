# delaunay-triangulation-domino3d

## diploma work

delaunay triangulation takes scanned points (defined as x,y,z) at input and computes ideal three dimensional mesh to create surface of scanned object using dealunay's mathematical equation tanscribed into algorithm

program exports 3D object into (\*.obj) file which can be read in any 3d editor or used as part of larger scale project

---

delaunay-triangulation-domino3d project
written in JAVA and C for paralel multithread GPU computing study

check `zip` branch for whole project (without some big size models and scans)
